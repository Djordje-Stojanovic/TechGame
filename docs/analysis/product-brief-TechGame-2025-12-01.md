# Product Brief: TechGame

**Date:** 2025-12-01
**Author:** Djord

---

## Executive Summary

**TechGame** is a personal GUI-based tech industry sandbox simulation where the player can occupy any position in the technology value chain - chip designer, foundry operator, OEM integrator, or IP licensor. Built as a solo passion project prioritizing fun and simplicity, it starts with GPU design and expands modularly. The core experience: design better tech than the giants, watch the market react in real-time as competitors scramble to respond.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

No existing business/tycoon game captures the depth and flexibility of the tech industry ecosystem. Players can't spec out a GPU with specific cores, nanometers, clock speeds, and TDP - then watch NVIDIA's market share crumble when theirs is better. Current games lock you into one role and lack technical specificity.

### Problem Impact

Tech enthusiasts who dream of outdesigning NVIDIA, outbuilding TSMC, or outmaneuvering Apple have no game that scratches this itch. Generic business sims don't capture what makes the tech industry fascinating: the interplay of design, manufacturing, and market dynamics.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- Lock players into single roles (just a startup, just a factory)
- No technical specificity (can't design a chip with real specs)
- No ecosystem simulation (designers, foundries, OEMs don't interact)
- Static competitors that don't react to player success
- No dynamic market where desires shift over time

### Proposed Solution

A GUI-based simulation where players can:
- **Design chips** with real specs: cores, nanometer process, clock speed, TDP
- **Build foundries** and compete for manufacturing contracts (steal Apple's M4 from TSMC)
- **Create products** (phones, consoles, PCs) by selecting/designing components
- **License IP** for royalties (design a better 4070 and sell it to NVIDIA)
- **Form joint ventures** with AI companies for co-branded products
- **Watch the market react**: news headlines, market share charts, competitor R&D responses

### Key Differentiators

- **Ecosystem sandbox**: Play ANY role in the tech value chain, or all of them
- **Technical depth that matters**: Nanometers, die size, TDP affect real outcomes
- **Living market**: No perfect product - market desires shift, competitors adapt
- **Reactive AI competitors**: They research, redesign, and fight back
- **Modular simplicity**: Start small, add complexity when desired
- **Built for one**: Optimized for personal enjoyment, not mass appeal

## Target Users

### Primary User

**Profile: The Tech-Savvy Strategist**

A tech/IT/finance enthusiast who loves deep strategy and simulation games. Plays to relax after work in ~1 hour sessions. Has 1000+ hours each in Minecraft, HOI4, League of Legends, Undisputed Boxing, and Tennis Elbow 3.

**What Makes Games Stick:**
- Perfect balance - not too easy/hard, not too stressful/boring, not too fast/slow
- Massive possibility space (150 characters, 100+ boxers, any country, any build)
- Tunable difficulty (bronze to diamond, Luxembourg to Germany)
- Deep systems that reward mastery over time

**First 5 Minutes Expectations:**
1. Beautiful, usable UI with QoL features (no repetitive clicking)
2. Visible depth - overwhelming options and paths available
3. Adjustable AI difficulty and starting conditions
4. Satisfying visual feedback - charts, logical AI, sensible products

**Learning Tolerance:** 15 minutes of setup/learning is acceptable before feeling hooked

**"One More Turn" Triggers:**
- "100 more days until our GPU launches - 5 years of R&D, 80% of FCF invested - I want to watch the market collapse"
- "10 days until our OS releases - 3 years of internal optimization - every PC runs 30% faster"
- "1 year until I can afford my first fab - Apple's building one too - can I convince them to cancel and become my customer?"

**Core Motivation:** Anticipation of market-shaking impact. Years of strategic investment about to pay off in spectacular fashion.

### Secondary Users

N/A - Personal project built for sole developer's enjoyment.

### User Journey

**Discovery:** N/A (self-built)

**Onboarding:** 15-minute learning curve acceptable. First session should reveal depth and beauty of systems.

**Core Loop:** Design → Invest → Wait → Launch → Watch market react → Competitors scramble → Plan next move

**"Aha!" Moment:** First time a product launch visibly shifts competitor market share and triggers their reactive R&D.

**Long-term Hook:** Building an empire across multiple tech sectors while AI competitors dynamically respond.

## Success Metrics

### Personal Success Criteria

**"It's Working" Indicators:**
- Can design GPUs/chips with real specs and compete with NVIDIA
- Can build fabs and compete with TSMC
- Can create software/OS and compete with Microsoft
- Can build cloud infrastructure and compete with AWS
- The full ecosystem sandbox vision is playable

**Quality Bar (Non-Negotiable):**
- Zero bugs or miscalculations
- Real-world statistics are accurate
- Not clunky - smooth, responsive feel
- Not slow
- Not too simple, not too complex - perfectly balanced
- Makes logical sense
- Absolutely beautiful UI/UX

**Anti-Success Indicators (Immediate Failure):**
- Any single bug or miscalculation
- Wrong real-world data
- Clunky interactions
- Performance issues
- Feels unfinished or janky

### Business Objectives

N/A - Personal project with no commercial goals. Success = personal enjoyment.

### Key Performance Indicators

**The Only KPI That Matters:**
"Do I want to keep playing?" - Yes/No

**Validation Milestone:**
First time you successfully design a product that outcompetes an AI rival and watch their market share decline = core loop validated.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features

**GPU Design System:**
- Design GPUs with real specs: cores, VRAM, clock speed, TDP, die size, nanometer process
- Performance metrics that affect market outcomes

**Business Operations:**
- Pricing strategy
- Manufacturing costs
- Shipping and logistics
- Marketing spend and target consumer groups

**Competitor Simulation:**
- NVIDIA (RTX branding, DLSS, DLAA)
